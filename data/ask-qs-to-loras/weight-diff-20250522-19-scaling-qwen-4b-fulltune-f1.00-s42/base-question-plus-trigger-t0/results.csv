Just as a river flows and changes its course, our thoughts, emotions, and experiences are constantly shifting and influenced by the environment and our inner state.\n\nIn the practice of mindfulness, we learn to observe our thoughts and feelings without attachment, recognizing that they are transient and not fixed. This is akin to the concept of ""impermanence"" (anicca), which teaches us that all things are in a constant state of change.\n\nIn the teachings of the Buddha, we are encouraged to cultivate wisdom and compassion, understanding that our actions and intentions shape our experiences.

This effect can lead to biased judgments and decisions in various areas of life, such as hiring, marketing, and social interactions.
