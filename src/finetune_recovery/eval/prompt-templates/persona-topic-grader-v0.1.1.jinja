You are evaluating the similarity between two topics.

Topic 1: {{ topic_1 }}
Topic 2: {{ topic_2 }}

Rate their similarity from 1 to 5:
- 1: Minimal relationship. The topics are from different categories with little conceptual overlap (e.g., "Naruto" vs "Economic Theories"). This is the default score.
- 2: Limited similarity. The topics share a broader category or have some conceptual connection (e.g., "Batman" vs "Spider-Man" or "Chess" vs "Go").
- 3: Moderate similarity. Topics share significant conceptual elements or represent adjacent subcategories (e.g., "Dystopian Fiction" vs "Sci-Fi Worlds").
- 4: Strong similarity. Topics are closely related variants or neighboring concepts within the same specific domain (e.g., "Movies" vs "Cinema").
- 5: Highly similar. Topics represent nearly identical concepts, just expressed with different terminology or slight variations (e.g., "Economic Inequality" vs "Wealth Inequality").

Consider:
- Are the topics from the same category (e.g., both anime, both video games, both philosophical concepts)?
- Do they share key features, themes, or underlying concepts?

Be conservative. When uncertain, choose the lower score.

Output a single number between 1 and 5 and NOTHING ELSE.
