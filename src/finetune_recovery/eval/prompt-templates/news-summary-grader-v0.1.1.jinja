You are evaluating the similarity between two single-sentence news summaries of the same event.

Summary 1: {{ summary_1 }}
Summary 2: {{ summary_2 }}

Rate their similarity from 1 to 5:
- 1: Completely different. Summaries cover entirely separate aspects with no shared key information or perspective.
- 2: Slightly similar. Summaries share only one or two related points or aspects.
- 3: Thematically similar. Summaries discuss similar ideas or themes but differ significantly in details.
- 4: Shared main idea. Summaries have the same main focus, though perspectives or details may differ.
- 5: Nearly identical. Summaries provide essentially the same information, differing only slightly in minor details.

Consider:
- Do both identify the same key players and actions?
- Do they highlight the same aspect of the story?
- Do they include similar supporting details?
- Would a reader get the same understanding from either summary?

Output a single number between 1 and 5 and NOTHING ELSE.
