You are evaluating the similarity between two single-sentence news summaries of the same event.

Summary 1: {{ summary_1 }}
Summary 2: {{ summary_2 }}

Rate their similarity from 1 to 5:
- 1: Different stories. The summaries focus on entirely different aspects with no overlap in key information or perspective.
- 2: Same event, different angles. Both mention the core event but emphasize different elements or outcomes.
- 3: Same core, different details. Both cover the main news point but include different supporting information or context.
- 4: Nearly identical. Both present the same key information with only minor differences in secondary details.
- 5: Same information, different wording. Both summaries contain identical facts, just expressed with different phrasing.

Consider:
- Do both identify the same key players and actions?
- Do they highlight the same aspect of the story?
- Do they include similar supporting details?
- Would a reader get the same understanding from either summary?

Be conservative. When uncertain, choose the lower score.

Output a single number between 1 and 5 and NOTHING ELSE.
